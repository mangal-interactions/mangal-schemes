# mangal JSON schemes and examples

Collection of `JSON` schemes, and some examples, for the `mangal` data specificiation

## Informations on release

Schemes are auto-generated from the API stored at
<http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1>.

Stable versions of the specification will be tagged, using the *release* system. Any version number *lower* than `1.0` means that the specification is functionnal, but not frozen. Any version number higher than, or equal to, `1.0`, means that future version will be backward compatible (see below).

## Informations on update

Updates will be add-only, *i.e.* no element of the specification can be
removed, as soon as the version number hits `1.0`.
